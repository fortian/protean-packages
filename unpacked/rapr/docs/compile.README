Stack movement

A new compile option in the rapr source tree moves the stack that RAPR uses to
a set location.  In order to enable the compile of this function, edit the
rapr/unix/Makefile.linux and remove the comment from the line containing the
-D_TESTBED.  This option must be compiled on a 2.6.10 Linux kernel to work
and to run the resulting executable, the EXEC_SHIELD on the linux kernel must
be turn off.  Otherwise, the execution would result in a
"Cannot execute: stack too low at bfe78ef0" error.
