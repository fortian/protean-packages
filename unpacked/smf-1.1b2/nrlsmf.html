<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
NRL Simplified Multicast Forwarding (<I>nrlsmf</I>) project includes
software for a user-space forwarding engine.  This software is was
developed by the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval
Research Laboratory</A></U></FONT> (NRL) PROTocol Engineering
Advanced Networking (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://protean.itd.nrl.navy.mil/">PROTEAN</A></U></FONT>)
Research Group.  The goal of this effort is to provide an
implementation of experimental techniques for robust, efficient
distribution of broadcast or multicast packets in dynamic, wireless
networks such as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs).  The <I>nrlsmf</I>
application can be run as a stand-alone application capable of
providing  &quot;classic&quot; flooding of broadcast and multicast
traffic for a specified network interface or can be used in
conjunction with a controlling program to perform more sophisticated
multicast forwarding.  An interprocess communication &quot;remote
control&quot; interface is provided so that a compatible program
(e.g. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects.php?name=olsr"><I>nrlolsr</I></A></U></FONT>)
may issue real-time commands to <I>nrlsmf</I> to control the
multicast forwarding process.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 operation are
supported.  Versions of <I>nrlsmf</I> can be built for the following
operating systems:  Linux, MacOS, BSD, Win32, and WinCE.  
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Theory of Operation</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
<I>nrlsmf</I> program acts as a packet forwarding engine by
promiscuously &quot;sniffing&quot; packets on a specified interface
and then retransmitting packets (using its local network interface
MAC address) according to set forwarding rules.  Currently, <I>nrlsmf</I>
only receives and forwards packets on a single, specified network
interface for operation within the &quot;routing area&quot;
corresponding to that (generally wireless) interface.  However,
future iterations of <I>nrlsmf</I> will also allow for packet
reception and forwarding across multiple interfaces to allow for
configurable gateway operation.  Currently, <I>nrlsmf</I> will
forward incoming (non-locally generated) packets that are IP
Multicast with time-to-live (TTL) greater than one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">Duplicate
packet detection is an important facet of wireless network multicast
forwarding since packets often must be forwarded on the same
interface as they are received.  Thus, neighbors' subsequent
retransmission of forwarded packets will be &quot;heard&quot; and the
local forwarding engine must discriminate between new packets and
previously-forwarded packets to avoid unnecessary retransmission. 
Accomplishing duplicate packet detection of native (unencapsulated)
IP packets presents several challenges:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	While the IPv4 packet &quot;id&quot; field (a 16-bit sequence)
	number is available to discriminate duplicate packets, its
	implementation varies in different operating systems (e.g. always
	set to ZERO, incremented on a &quot;per socket&quot; basis instead
	of global, etc).  Furthermore, when incremented on a global basis
	(with respect to the originating host's IP packet transmission),
	other data flows (TCP sockets or other multicast or unicast flows)
	may cause the field to be incremented haphazardly (or wrap quickly)
	with respect to a specific flow of traffic to be forwarded by an SMF
	engine.  Ideally, a sequence number that incremented on a per-IP
	destination basis (with respect to an originating source) would be
	most useful for duplicate packet detection.  There are also further
	issues to consider with respect to the possibility of IP security
	(IPSec) operation or network address translation (NAT) presence that
	complicate matters here.  However, regardless of these issues, the
	current <I>nrlsmf</I> implementation boldly uses the IP &quot;id&quot;
	field for duplicate packet discrimination.  Work is in progress to
	develop mechanisms to &quot;correct&quot; the IP &quot;id&quot;
	field (or possibly insert an header option) on hosts participating
	in networks with SMF.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	In IPv6, there is no equivalent to the IPv4 &quot;id&quot; field, so
	duplicate detection is further complicated.  The current <I>nrlsmf</I>
	 implementation has a partially-implemented feature that attempts to
	mitigate this by adding a hop-by-hop options header for detected,
	locally-generated IPv6 flows.  Then, incoming flows that have the
	option header are forwarded.  This results in two copies of each
	generated multicast packet on the first hop, but correct forwarding
	on subsequent hops.  A similar approach could be adopted to
	&quot;correct&quot; IPv4 &quot;id&quot; fields on systems where this
	is needed in lieu of outbound packet interception.  Again, we are
	investigating approaches to outbound packet interception for
	supported operating systems to provide a more efficient experimental
	capability for long-term use.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Also under investigation are approaches to using &quot;hash&quot;
	functions for duplicate detection.  Preliminary results indicate
	these approaches are complex for per-packet processing and imperfect
	with respect to false duplicate detection which results in
	undesirable packet loss, perhaps unrecoverable even with end-to-end
	reliability mechanisms.  But further investigation is merited.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Encapsulation of packets for forwarding has some advantages in that
	discrimination for duplicate packet detection can be carefully
	controlled.  The principle disadvantage is that edge wireless
	systems (not participating in packet forwarding) without explicit
	SMF support for decapsulation would be unable to receive multicast
	transmissions they would have otherwise been able to receive had
	native IP packet formats been used.</P>
</OL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
<I>nrlsmf</I> currently forwards based on its configuration and
possibly the source MAC address of received packets meeting TTL
criteria.  If &quot;default forwarding&quot; is enabled, <I>nrlsmf</I>
will forward all non-duplicate, TTL &gt; 1, multicast packets. 
Otherwise, <I>nrlsmf</I> only forwards packets with MAC source
addresses matching those in a list provided by a separate controlling
program (e.g. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects.php?name=olsr"><I>nrlolsr</I></A></U></FONT>).
 Future versions of <I>nrlsmf</I> will feature additional options to
control the forwarding process and allow experiments with different
algorithms and techniques.</P>
